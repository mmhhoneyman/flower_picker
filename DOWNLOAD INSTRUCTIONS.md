If you have a Java Runtime Environment installed on your computer, simply download the "Mother's Day.jar" file in this the main branch.

If not, here's a link to my itch.io page:

There will be two downloads. You want the "mothers-day-installer.exe". Once downloaded, follow the instructions on the installer and the game will pop up in your desktop!
