If you have a Java Runtime Environment installed on your computer, simply download the "Mother's Day.jar" file in this the main branch. This will NOT run on any version older than JDK 23.

If not, here's a link to my itch.io page:
https://mckeon-honeyman.itch.io/mothers-day

Click the download button. There is a SKIPPABLE donation page that will pop up. There will be two downloads. You want the "mothers-day-installer.exe". Once downloaded, follow the instructions on the installer and the game will pop up in your desktop!
